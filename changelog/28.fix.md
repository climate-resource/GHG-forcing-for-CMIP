+ fix error during building documentation
+ error relates to credentials of cds that can't be found
+ issue arises when environment variables in RtD are not public (see [here](https://docs.readthedocs.com/platform/stable/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-and-build-process))
+ workaround: make env. variables public such that build passes on PR
+ next steps: revoke tokens & make key private & re-run 'latest' build on RtD
