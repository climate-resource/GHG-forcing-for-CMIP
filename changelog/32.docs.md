+ inspect coverage of ground-based and satellite data
+ create "tutorial" in docs (`docs/tutorials/inspect-gridding.py`) for visual inspection of spatial coverage of ground-based and satellite data
+ include function (`utils.weighted_average`) and test (`tests/unit/test_utils.py::test_weighted_average`) for computing weighted average that takes spherical nature of global grid into account when averaging over latitudes.
