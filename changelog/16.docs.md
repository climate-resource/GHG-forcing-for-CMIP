+ create tutorial in docs for inspecting collocated data (raw ground-based data vs. satellite product)
+ remove spikes in ground-based data by including quality flag filter in `download_ground_based.py`
+ inspect data for specific collocated sites (selected according to highest number of observations)
+ include measure for computing discrepancy between ground-based and satellite time series
    + RMSE
    + correlation distance
