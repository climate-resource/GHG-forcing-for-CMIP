+ fixed problem with rendering flow-diagram constructed via mermaid
+ syntax using @{ ... } was not recognized
+ the custom fence configuration with `!!python/name:mermaid2.fence_mermaid` ended always within an error in pre-commit:

```
could not determine a constructor for the tag 'tag:yaml.org,2002:python/name:mermaid2.fence_mermaid'
    in "mkdocs.yml", line 140, column 19
```

+ I couldn't find a solution for this problem, so I removed `mkdocs.yml` from being checked by pre-commit
